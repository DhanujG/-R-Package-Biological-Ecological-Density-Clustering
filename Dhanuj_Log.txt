My log to keep track of completed tasks and tasks to complete

NOTE#  IMPLEMENTED 


Added Python Functionality in findvalidation for DBCV - DONE

Editing Estimate DC from DensityClust to include weights - DONE

Editing Densityclust else statement (r dist matrix passed in) for localdensity to include weights
        First editing Non Gaussian -DONE
        First editing Gaussian -DONE (check again for mathematical validity)

Weight Functionality is working!

Editing PlotMDS to scale points based on weights- DONE

DBCV fixed without weights- DONE

Cluster center shape turned into filled triangle with cross mark

DBCV implemented into regular cluster execution

DBCV was null with weighted points

Created RAW and TSNE plots

Created Spectral Clustering
	-need to double check distance implementation and plot implementation





NOTE#  TODO implement   

     
			Implement knn
			Implement Validation Metrics
			Implement DBSCAN
			Clean up code 
			Publish Package
			
			
			Get working - fix MST with weights
			Create Package
			DBCV with weights
			Fix plots in densityclust and execute 
			knn with weights 
			convert dbcv to c++
			convert density clust to main
			Wrap in Package
